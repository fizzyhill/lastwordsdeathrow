# lastwordsdeathrow

Since 1982, 548 death row inmates have been executed in Texas alone. 433 of them have left a last statement, recorded by the stateâ€™s Department of Criminal Justice.

This project builds on the work of My Khe Nguyen on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mykhe1097/last-words-of-death-row-inmates), who pulled data from the said archive, and visualizes the most frequently used words in those statements in an interactive graph. 

Common English words (https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-stopwords.html) have been removed from the data.
