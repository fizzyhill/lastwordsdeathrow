# lastwordsdeathrow

Since 1982, 548 death row inmates have been executed in Texas alone. 433 of them have left a last statement, recorded by the stateâ€™s Department of Criminal Justice.

This project builds on the work of My Khe Nguyen on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mykhe1097/last-words-of-death-row-inmates), who pulled data from the said archive, and visualizes the most frequently used words in those statements in an interactive graph. The code here is just for the plotting. I did not do the word frequency count myself but used several tools available online (www.writewords.org.uk/word_count.asp, https://www.textfixer.com/tools/online-word-counter.php), and cross-checked the results.

Common English words (I referenced MYSQL's list of stop words: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-stopwords.html) have been removed from the data.
